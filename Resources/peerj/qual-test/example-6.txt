We undertook a qualitative study, based on open-ended interviews conducted with clinical and administrative staff during hospital site visits from March through June of 2000. The qualitative approach was chosen for 2 reasons. First, with the exception of a recent randomized controlled trial,24 few studies have investigated factors specific to improvements either in the care of patients with AMI or in β-blocker use. Qualitative research is particularly well suited for exploratory studies for which previous literature is limited.26 Such studies are useful for generating hypotheses that can later be tested with quantitative data.26- 27 Second, we anticipated that some factors, such as administrative philosophy and physician leadership, may be multifaceted and difficult to measure. Again, qualitative research provides a method for describing the diverse facets and dimensions of such factors.26,28

As is standard in qualitative research,26- 27 we chose sites using purposeful sampling to ensure that we included a diverse set of hospitals. Study hospitals were selected to reflect a range of geographical regions, hospital size, AMI volume, and improvement or decline in β-blocker use over time. Hospitals were not selected based on knowledge of their approach to measuring and improving care. Additional hospitals were selected and visited until no new concepts were identified by the additional interviews, ie, until the point of theoretical saturation. This occurred after the eighth hospital site visit and 45 interviews. The research team was blinded to hospital rates of β-blocker use until the completion of the data collection and coding. The characteristics of the study hospitals are displayed in Table 1.
