We are conducting a 5-year prospective cohort study consisting of 4 interview cycles. The multiethnic, population-based sample consists of 86 San Francisco residents with recently diagnosed breast cancer (response rate = 87%). Findings are determined using qualitative analysis of transcribed interviews.
