We interviewed 45 patients with lung cancer throughout the United Kingdom. To look at experience in all stages of lung cancer, our maximum variation sample included men and women, young and older, from various social backgrounds; people diagnosed as having small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer; and mesothelioma, and people who had been medically treated in different ways (table).20 Originally we aimed to include about 40 patients, but we continued interviewing until we obtained the sample described. People were invited to participate through general practices, oncologists, chest physicians, and support groups.

Characteristics of 45 patients interviewed about their lung cancer

With informed consent, one of the authors (AC, a medical sociologist), interviewed patients in their homes between October 2002 and August 2003. Patients were asked to tell their story from when they first suspected they had a problem. Among other things, we were interested in people's perception of the cause of their illness and how others reacted to the diagnosis. Many patients talked about stigma and expressed feelings of guilt or shame. The interviews lasted one to three hours and were audiotaped.

Transcribed transcripts were returned to each respondent for revision if necessary. From the transcripts we developed categories or themes.21 Sections of text were marked and linked to sections of text from other interviews that covered similar issues or experiences by using NUD*IST.22 Themes were considered in the context of all the interviews.23 24 Inter-rater reliability scores were not developed as the interviews had little structureâ€”such scores are not appropriate to data that have little or no predefined coding25; AC and SZ regularly discussed the coding and interpretation of the data.
