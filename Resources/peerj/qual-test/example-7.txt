Eligible hospitals were those that participated in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI)12 continuously for at least 30 months during the 36-month (October 1996-September 1999) observation period. In addition, eligible hospitals had to report at least 40 patients with AMI on an annual basis during the study or observation period. The cut point between the baseline and follow-up periods was chosen as the midpoint between the time of the first and last patient submission to the NRMI during the observation period. While NRMI does not include all hospitals in the country, it does include a broad spectrum of facilities and is the largest ongoing registry with detailed clinical and medication information. The chosen baseline and follow-up periods reflect time before and after the dissemination of new data demonstrating the effectiveness of β-blockers for patients with AMI.11,14 The mean improvement in β-blocker use from baseline to follow-up was 6 percentage points.

To ensure that the study hospitals reflected a range of β-blocker use rates, we arrayed all eligible hospitals into 20 quantiles according to their change in β-blocker use (mean [SD] β-blocker use rate of all patients with AMI: 54.2% [14.1%] during baseline vs 60.0% [12.7%] during follow-up). We randomly selected hospitals from the lowest 2 quantiles (representing declines in β-blocker use rates ranging from −22 and −6 percentage points), the middle 2 quantiles (representing increases in use rates ranging from 5-7 percentage points), and the highest 2 quantiles (representing increases in use rates from 19-35 percentage points). In 2 cases, randomly selected hospitals did not meet other selection criteria (ie, they did not reflect a range of sizes or geographical regions) and thus were replaced with other randomly selected hospitals from the same quantiles.
