JB conducted all interviews in patients' homes, based on a topic guide derived from a review of existing studies and three pilot interviews. A final version had evolved after the 12th interview. We sought to interview two patients with hypertension who had dropped out of treatment, but neither consented.

We analysed transcripts of the interviews in five steps: identification of themes, generation of a code to label passages, revision of themes and coding scheme as we accumulated data, application of codes to the final dataset, and exploration of the themes' relationships within and among patients.18 JB and NB generated independent initial coding schemes; differences were resolved by discussion. JB elaborated the coding scheme and applied the final code, with confirmation of consistency through blind dual coding of two transcripts with NB. After 38 interviews (excluding pilot interviews), tape recorded with participants' consent, analysis showed that we had reached theoretical saturation.17

We validated our findings by sending respondents a summary of our conclusions based on the taxonomy shown in the box and inviting their comments (table 3).
