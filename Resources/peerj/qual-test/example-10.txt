After approval from the committee for research ethics, we identified all patients receiving repeat prescriptions for antihypertensives in two urban general practices; patients were either tenants or lived in council, housing association, or privately owned homes. We chose patients in nine groups of between three and six at a time to represent a range of characteristics. We interviewed them separately to explore their perceptions about antihypertensive drugs. Repeating the interview process nine times permitted interplay between the sampling, data collection, and data analysis: the process abided by the principles of developing grounded theory. Theoretical sampling, however, for a range of previously unidentified perceptions, was impracticable,16 and therefore we sought a maximum variety sample with respect to age, sex, years taking antihypertensives, type and number of antihypertensives, numbers of non-antihypertensive drugs prescribed, and regularity of collection of drugs according to repeat prescription records.17 Where patients declined to be interviewed, we invited substitutes with similar characteristics. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the practices and summarises the sampling process. Table 2 shows the characteristics of interviewees.
